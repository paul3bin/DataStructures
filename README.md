# DataStructures
Python code for different data structures. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.
<ul>
  <li>Traversing</li>
  <li>Searching</li>
  <li>Insertion</li>
  <li>Deletion</li>
  <li>Sorting</li>
  <li>Merging</li>
</ul>
